# Homepage

Homepage should have:
1. Today's games
2. Yesterday's scores
3. Ongoing competitions (MLS, MLS Playoffs, US Open Cup, CONCACAF)


Team Detail should have recent scores graph.






#### Stats

Every game is part of several competitions. We save stats for each competition into a stats object. That should be relatively standard. 
Try to generate stats for everything that doesn't have them.

So a FC Dallas regular season  2011 game would be part of:
MLS regular season 2011, regularseasoncareer, everythingcareer, FC Dallas regular season 2011, FC Dallas regular season
National team by competition, nationalteam2011, nationalteamcareer

An FC Dallas playoff game would be part of:
MLS playofss 2011, playoffscareer, everythingcareer, FC Dallas playoffs 2011, FC Dalals playoffs

A friendly would be part of:
friendly, (that's it)

This would solve the long-lasting MLS open cup / regular season problem.

#### Soccermetrics

Difference vs ratio question about scores.

Is a 3-1 victory more like a 6-2 or a 6-4 victory?

Determines motivations of teams.
